# Dive Design System Documentation

Comprehensive documentation for the Dive Design System, covering both operational component development and strategic planning.

## üìÅ Documentation Structure

### **üß© [Component Creation](./component-creation/)**
Systematic workflow for creating Stencil web components from Figma designs.

**Complete 8-phase process:**
1. Project Context - System architecture understanding
2. Figma Requirements - Design analysis and validation
3. Technical Implementation - Stencil patterns and conventions
4. Living Blueprint - Reference implementation patterns
5. Quality Assurance - Validation checklists and testing
6. Problem Database - Known issues and solutions (Living Document)
7. User Feedback - Community insights (Living Document)
8. Decision Log - Architectural decisions (Living Document)

**Start here for:** Component development, technical implementation, quality standards

### **üìä [Strategy](./strategy/)**
Market analysis, competitive positioning, and strategic planning documentation.

**Strategic planning documents:**
- Industry Benchmark - 8.5/10 evaluation against 2024-2025 standards
- Roadmap Priorities - Data-driven development roadmap
- Competitive Advantages - Market positioning and differentiation
- Executive Summary - One-page stakeholder overview
- Quarterly Review Template - Strategic assessment process

**Start here for:** Business planning, competitive analysis, stakeholder communication

## üìö Documentation Philosophy

### **Living Documentation**
Both documentation sections follow a "living documentation" approach:
- **Component Creation**: Captures evolving best practices and solutions
- **Strategy**: Reflects current market position and competitive landscape

### **Systematic Approach**
- **Operational**: 8-phase component creation with validation gates
- **Strategic**: Quarterly reviews with data-driven decision making

### **Knowledge Retention**
- **Problem Database**: Prevents repeated technical mistakes
- **Decision Log**: Captures architectural rationale
- **Industry Benchmark**: Maintains competitive awareness
