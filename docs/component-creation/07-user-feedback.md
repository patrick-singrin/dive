## üéØ Recent Feedback

### Feedback #001: Initial System Design
**Date**: 2024-12  
**Source**: System Designer  
**Type**: System Architecture  
**Rating**: N/A (Initial Design)

#### Feedback
"The previous 709-line monolithic prompt was overwhelming and ineffective. Multiple expert perspectives unanimously support the modular approach with living documents."

#### Key Points
- **Separation of Concerns**: Requirements, implementation, and QA should be separate
- **Living Knowledge**: Problem database prevents repeated mistakes
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Developers can focus on relevant information
- **Decision Preservation**: Decision log prevents architectural drift

#### Action Items
- [x] Create modular documentation structure
- [x] Implement living documents for problems and feedback
- [ ] Test system with real component creation
- [ ] Measure success metrics after implementation

#### Status
üöß **In Progress** - Implementing modular system
