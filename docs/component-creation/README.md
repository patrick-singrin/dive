# üìö Component Creation Documentation System

## üéØ Purpose
This documentation system provides a comprehensive, modular approach to creating Stencil Web Components from Figma designs. Unlike the previous monolithic prompt, this system separates concerns for better maintainability and developer experience.

## üìñ Reading Order & Navigation

### üèóÔ∏è **Phase 1: Context & Setup**
1. **[Project Context](./01-project-context.md)** - Understanding the Dive Design System architecture
2. **[Figma Requirements](./02-figma-requirements.md)** - What we need from Figma designs
   - **Includes User Validation Step**: Confirm component analysis before implementation

### üîß **Phase 2: Implementation**  
3. **[Technical Implementation](./03-technical-implementation.md)** - Stencil patterns, conventions, and code examples
4. **[Living Blueprint](./04-living-blueprint.md)** - Reference implementation patterns (replaces specific component references)

### ‚úÖ **Phase 3: Quality & Improvement**
5. **[Quality Assurance](./05-quality-assurance.md)** - Validation checklist and testing requirements
6. **[Problem Database](./06-problem-database.md)** - Known issues and solutions (LIVING DOCUMENT)
7. **[User Feedback](./07-user-feedback.md)** - Community insights and improvement suggestions (LIVING DOCUMENT)
8. **[Decision Log](./08-decision-log.md)** - Major architectural decisions and rationale (LIVING DOCUMENT)

## üîÑ Using This System

### For First-Time Users
1. Read files 1-5 in order to understand the complete system
2. **Collaborate during analysis**: Validate component properties before implementation begins
3. Use file 4 (Living Blueprint) as your primary reference during component creation
4. Follow file 5 (Quality Assurance) checklist before considering a component complete

### For Experienced Users
- Jump directly to **Living Blueprint** for implementation patterns
- Consult **Problem Database** when encountering issues
- Update **User Feedback** with new insights

### For System Maintainers
- Regularly update living documents (files 6-8) based on team experience
- Review and improve **Living Blueprint** based on successful component patterns
- Archive outdated patterns and promote new best practices

## üéØ Success Metrics

This documentation system aims to achieve:
- **95%+ First-Time Build Success** - Components build correctly on first attempt
- **Pixel-Perfect Figma Matching** - Visual designs match exactly
- **Zero Repeated Mistakes** - Problem database prevents known issues
- **Sub-30 Minute Component Creation** - From Figma to working component
- **Consistent Implementation Patterns** - All components follow same conventions

## üö® Critical Guidelines

### Living Documents Protocol
Files marked as **LIVING DOCUMENT** should be updated by:
- **Developers**: Add problems/solutions during component creation
- **Designers**: Provide feedback on Figma‚ÜíComponent translation accuracy  
- **Maintainers**: Archive resolved issues, promote successful patterns

### Version Control
- Each major change to this system should be documented in the **Decision Log**
- Always test the complete documentation system with real component creation
- Update the **Living Blueprint** before deprecating old patterns

**Next Steps**: 
1. Read [Project Context](./01-project-context.md) to understand the Dive Design System
2. Follow the numbered files in sequence for your first component creation
3. Contribute back to living documents to help the next developer

*This documentation system replaces the previous `prompt_new_component.md` monolith and follows modular documentation best practices.*
