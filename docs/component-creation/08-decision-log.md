# üìã Decision Log

*LIVING DOCUMENT - Update when major architectural decisions are made*

## Purpose
This document captures significant decisions about the Dive Design System component creation process, including the rationale, alternatives considered, and outcomes. This prevents decision drift and helps future teams understand why certain choices were made.

## Major Decisions

### üîÑ **Decision #001: Migration from Lit to Stencil Framework**
**Date**: 2024 (Referenced in STENCIL_MIGRATION_SUCCESS.md)  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented  
**Decision Maker**: Development Team

#### Context
The project initially explored Lit framework for web components but migrated to Stencil.

#### Decision
Adopt Stencil as the primary framework for all component development.

#### Rationale
- **Natural CSS Variable Inheritance**: Stencil handles CSS custom property inheritance automatically in shadow DOM, eliminating the need for manual forwarding
- **Scale Design System Alignment**: Same framework used by Scale Design System, ensuring consistency and proven patterns
- **TypeScript Integration**: Built-in TypeScript support with automatic type generation
- **Build Optimization**: Better build output and component distribution
- **Developer Experience**: Simpler development workflow with automatic component registration

#### Alternatives Considered
- **Lit Framework**: Rejected due to CSS variable inheritance complexity
- **Native Web Components**: Rejected due to development overhead and tooling gaps

#### Impact
- Simplified component development process
- Automatic CSS variable inheritance without manual forwarding
- Better alignment with industry-standard design system frameworks
- Improved build pipeline and distribution

#### Success Metrics
- ‚úÖ Zero CSS variable inheritance issues
- ‚úÖ Simplified component creation workflow
- ‚úÖ Consistent patterns across all components

### üîÑ **Decision #002: Modular Documentation System**
**Date**: 2024-12  
**Status**: üöß In Progress  
**Decision Maker**: Development Team

#### Context
Previous documentation was a single 709-line `prompt_new_component.md` file that was difficult to maintain and use.

#### Decision
Split documentation into 8 focused files with living documents for continuous improvement.

#### Rationale
- **Separation of Concerns**: Requirements, implementation, and QA should be separate
- **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused files are easier to update and maintain
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Developers can focus on relevant information for their current task
- **Living Knowledge**: Problem database and feedback capture institutional knowledge
- **Decision Preservation**: Decision log prevents architectural drift

#### Alternatives Considered
- **Status Quo**: Single large file - rejected due to usability issues
- **Wiki System**: External documentation - rejected to keep everything in-repo
- **Automated Generation**: Tool-generated docs - rejected due to need for human insights

#### Impact
- Improved developer onboarding experience
- Better documentation maintenance
- Systematic capture of institutional knowledge
- Prevention of repeated mistakes

#### Success Metrics
- [ ] 95%+ first-time build success rate
- [ ] Reduced component creation time
- [ ] Fewer repeated issues
- [ ] Higher documentation usage

### üîÑ **Decision #003: Collaborative Analysis Workflow**
**Date**: 2024-12  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented  
**Decision Maker**: Development Team  

#### Context
Automated Figma analysis tools (MCP Server) provide comprehensive data, but may miss design intent, edge cases, or implicit requirements that only humans can identify.

#### Decision
Implement a collaborative validation step where the LLM presents component analysis to the user for confirmation before proceeding with implementation.

#### Rationale
- **Human Context**: Users have design intent knowledge that tools can't capture
- **Error Prevention**: Catch missing properties before implementation begins
- **Collaborative Workflow**: Combine AI efficiency with human insight
- **Quality Improvement**: Reduce rework from incomplete component analysis
- **Learning Loop**: Human feedback improves future analysis accuracy

#### Alternatives Considered
- **Fully Automated**: Trust MCP server data completely - rejected due to missing context
- **Fully Manual**: Human-only analysis - rejected due to inefficiency
- **Post-Implementation Review**: Check after building - rejected due to rework cost

#### Impact
- Prevents building components with missing functionality
- Creates collaborative human-AI workflow
- Reduces implementation iterations
- Improves component completeness and accuracy

#### Success Metrics
- [ ] Reduced component rework due to missing properties
- [ ] Higher first-time implementation accuracy
- [ ] Better human-AI collaboration patterns
- [ ] Improved component quality scores

### üîÑ **Decision #004: Living Blueprint Over Component References**
**Date**: 2024-12  
**Status**: üöß Planned  
**Decision Maker**: Development Team  

#### Context
Current documentation references specific components (Badge, Icon) as examples, creating tight coupling and version drift.

#### Decision
Create a "Living Blueprint" component that showcases all implementation patterns in one place.

#### Rationale
- **Single Source of Truth**: All patterns in one location
- **Decoupling**: No dependency on specific production components
- **Comprehensive Examples**: Can show edge cases and advanced patterns
- **Version Stability**: Blueprint evolves independently of production components

#### Alternatives Considered
- **Multiple Example Components**: Rejected due to maintenance overhead
- **Documentation-Only Examples**: Rejected due to lack of working code
- **External Examples Repository**: Rejected to keep everything in-repo

#### Impact
- Reduced coupling between documentation and production components
- Comprehensive pattern showcase in single location
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Better developer learning experience

#### Success Metrics
- [ ] Single reference point for all implementation patterns
- [ ] Reduced documentation maintenance overhead
- [ ] Improved pattern consistency across components

## Decision Process

### How to Add New Decisions
1. **Identify Significant Decision**: Not every small choice needs documentation
2. **Use Template**: Follow the format above for consistency
3. **Gather Context**: Explain why the decision was needed
4. **Document Alternatives**: Show what else was considered
5. **Define Success Metrics**: How will we know if this was the right choice?
6. **Update Status**: Track implementation progress

### Decision Criteria
Document decisions that:
- Affect multiple components or the entire system
- Change fundamental architecture or patterns
- Have long-term maintenance implications
- Represent significant trade-offs or compromises
- Override previous decisions or industry standards

### Review Process
- **Quarterly Review**: Assess outcomes of recent decisions
- **Annual Audit**: Review all decisions for continued relevance
- **Migration Support**: Update decisions when patterns evolve
