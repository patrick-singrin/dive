# Guidelines: Creating New CSS Components & Stories

## Workflow (Recommended)

1. **Edit your component's `.css` file** in `src/components/` (this is the source of truth).
2. **Run the watcher** to auto-generate Lit CSS files:
   ```sh
   npm run watch:lit-css
   ```
   The watcher will keep Lit CSS files (e.g., `ComponentName.styles.ts`) in sync with your `.css` files.
3. **Import the generated Lit styles** in your component:
   ```ts
   import { componentNameStyles } from './ComponentName.styles';
   export class ComponentName extends LitElement {
     static styles = [componentNameStyles];
     // ...
   }
   ```

## 1. File Structure

Each component should have its own folder:

```
src/components/ComponentName/
  ComponentName.ts
  ComponentName.css
  ComponentName.styles.ts
  ComponentName.stories.ts
```

## 2. Using Design Tokens

- Always use CSS variables for color, spacing, border-radius, etc.
- Reference tokens from the design system (e.g., `var(--border-border-radius-lg)`).

## 3. Shadow DOM & CSS Variables

**Automatic CSS Variable Forwarding**

All CSS variables used in your component's styles (i.e., any `var(--...)` in your `.css` file) are now automatically forwarded to the shadow DOM. This means you do **not** need to manually forward variables in your Lit componentâ€”any variable you use in your CSS will be available in the shadow DOM and work as expected.

*This automation is now the default and recommended approach for all new components.*

## 4. Storybook Integration

- Import the component and its CSS in the story file.
- Use real design tokens in stories to ensure consistency.

## 5. Common Pitfalls & Fixes

- **Shadow DOM variable issues:** This is now handled automatically.
- **CSS specificity:** Prefer component styles over global overrides.
- **Storybook style conflicts:** Use unique class names and avoid global selectors.

## 6. Checklist

- [ ] Component folder created
- [ ] Uses design tokens
- [ ] CSS variables used in CSS (auto-forwarded)
- [ ] Storybook story created
- [ ] Manual test in Storybook

## 7. Troubleshooting

If a style is not applied, check:
- Is the variable available in the shadow DOM? (Should be automatic)
- Is there a more specific selector overriding your style?
- Is Storybook injecting conflicting styles?
